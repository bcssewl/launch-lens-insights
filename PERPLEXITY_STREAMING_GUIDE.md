# Perplexity-Style Streaming Implementation Guide

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The Perplexity-style streaming research experience has been fully implemented in the Optivise AI Assistant. This document outlines the complete implementation, features, and testing approach.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **`usePerplexityStreaming.ts`** - Main streaming hook
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Event parsing and state tracking
   - Error handling with REST fallback
   - Progress tracking (0-100%)

2. **`SourceCard.tsx`** - Professional source cards
   - Clickable source cards with icons
   - Confidence indicators with color coding
   - Clean Perplexity-style design

3. **`StreamingProgress.tsx`** - Real-time progress overlay
   - Current research phase display
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - Live search queries display
   - Source discovery in real-time

4. **Updated `useMessages.ts`** - Smart query routing
   - Research query detection
   - Streaming vs REST API routing
   - Centralized state management

## 🚀 Key Features

### Smart Query Detection
```typescript
// Research queries → WebSocket streaming
"Analyze fintech market trends in 2024"
"What are the competitive advantages of Tesla?"

// Simple queries → Instant REST responses  
"Hello"
"Thank you"
```

### WebSocket Events Supported
- `search` - Shows search queries being used
- `source` - Adds discovered sources progressively  
- `snippet` - Displays analysis snippets
- `thought` - Updates current research phase
- `complete` - Final response with sources

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Real-time progress indicators
- ✅ Professional source cards with confidence scores
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Clean Perplexity-style aesthetics

## 🔌 WebSocket Integration

### Connection Details
```
Endpoint: wss://ai-agent-research-optivise-production.up.railway.app/stream
Message Format: {"query": "user question", "context": {"sessionId": "uuid"}}
```

### Error Handling
- Connection failures → Automatic REST fallback
- Timeout handling → 45-second maximum
- Network issues → Exponential backoff retry
- Parsing errors → User-friendly messages

## 📱 Component Integration

### ChatArea.tsx
- Displays streaming progress overlay when active
- Shows source cards below streaming messages
- Maintains existing message display

### AIAssistantPage.tsx  
- Passes `streamingState` to all components
- Preserves existing layout and functionality
- Supports both normal and fullscreen modes

### FullscreenChatLayout.tsx
- Updated to use new `streamingState` prop
- Consistent streaming experience in fullscreen

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Research Queries (Should Stream)**
   ```
   "Analyze the competitive landscape of AI chatbots"
   "What are the market trends in electric vehicles?"
   "Research opportunities in renewable energy sector"
   "Compare different cloud computing platforms"
   ```

2. **Simple Queries (Should Be Instant)**
   ```
   "Hello"
   "Hi there"
   "Thank you"
   "Good morning"
   ```

3. **Error Testing**
   - Disconnect internet → Should fallback to REST
   - Send malformed queries → Should handle gracefully
   - Test on mobile devices → Should be responsive

### Expected Behavior

#### For Research Queries:
1. Streaming progress overlay appears
2. Progress bar shows 0-100%
3. Current phase updates ("Searching...", "Analyzing...", etc.)
4. Source cards appear progressively
5. Final response replaces streaming content
6. Sources remain clickable below response

#### For Simple Queries:
1. No streaming overlay
2. Instant response appears
3. Normal chat behavior maintained

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Design
- **Clean aesthetics** matching Perplexity's style
- **White background** with subtle shadows
- **Professional typography** and spacing
- **Smooth animations** for state transitions

### User Experience
- **Non-blocking** - Users can continue chatting
- **Informative** - Clear progress and phase indicators  
- **Responsive** - Works on all device sizes
- **Accessible** - Proper contrast and readable text

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Selection
- **Stratix model** → Uses Perplexity-style streaming
- **Other models** → Uses existing N8N webhook

### Session Management
- Maintains existing session functionality
- Streaming state persists within sessions
- Proper cleanup on session changes

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- WebSocket endpoint must be accessible
- CORS configuration for streaming domain
- Session management for WebSocket context

### Performance Considerations
- WebSocket connections are cleaned up properly
- Progress updates are throttled to prevent UI lag
- Memory usage is optimized for long sessions

## 🔍 Debugging

### Debug Logging
Comprehensive console logging is enabled:
- `🎯 Stratix Request - Smart routing`
- `🚀 Using Perplexity-style streaming`
- `⚡ Using instant response`
- `🔄 ChatArea: Rendering message`

### Common Issues
1. **No streaming overlay** → Check if query is detected as research
2. **WebSocket errors** → Verify endpoint accessibility
3. **No sources appearing** → Check event parsing logic
4. **Mobile layout issues** → Test responsive breakpoints

## ✅ Implementation Checklist
