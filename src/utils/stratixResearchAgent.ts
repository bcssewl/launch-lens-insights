I initiated a comprehensive research workflow for your query: "${query}"

However, I encountered some technical difficulties during the multi-step research process. Let me provide you with a preliminary analysis based on my core knowledge:

## Key Considerations

Based on your query, here are some initial strategic insights:

- **Research Scope**: This appears to require deep consulting-level analysis
- **Complexity Level**: Multi-faceted research with strategic implications
- **Recommended Approach**: Systematic analysis across multiple dimensions

## Next Steps

To provide you with the comprehensive research analysis you're looking for, please consider:

1. **Refining the Query**: Provide more specific parameters or focus areas
2. **Defining Success Metrics**: What specific outcomes are you seeking?
3. **Contextual Information**: Any background or constraints I should consider?

I'm designed to excel at deep consulting research, and I'd be happy to restart the analysis with more focused parameters.
